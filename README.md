# Study complexity others SVD-Entropy

## Description

Classify photorealistic rendering image as noisy or not noisy using scene complexity criteria.

Pretrained K-means model is used for taking care of scene complexity. Following clusters, a specific model is trained for each one.
Hence, data are prepared for each specific model based on this K-means model.
